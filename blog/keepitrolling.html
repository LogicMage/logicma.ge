            <h2>REVIEW: Another Childhood, and more importantly, Keep It Rolling</h2>

            <p>The liner notes for Jim Nopédie’s <a href="https://jimnopedie.bandcamp.com/album/another-childhood" target="_blank"><i>Another Childhood</i></a> describe the album as a rejection of “nostalgia culture’s halcyon depiction of childhood, and retro video gaming, in favour of something more intriguing, more eerily undefined.” At first glance that’s an intriguing position to take on the subject, seeing as how for many a video game played as a child represents a symbol of something that is pure. A project imparting a personal influence that may stay with the player for ages - a work passed from creator to child. 
            </p>
            <p>But recent internet culture has taken interest in the prospect of that system’s corruption. As early as 2019, websites like 4chan’s /v/ board have worked to create folkcanon that rejects this norm with creepypastas such as “The Wario Apparition” - spirits existing within forgotten games that manifest in our reality by becoming active within the players’ subconscious. Considering the inherently interactive nature of the medium at play, it is important to note the <i>player’s</i> involvement in this system as a witness. Until these hidden facets of a game come to light through active discovery, they are just those - folktales, they hold no power - and again, we note the dynamic between creator and player.
            </p>
            <p><i>Another Childhood</i> is not based on what I’ve just described, exactly, but it is perhaps useful to look at the work through this lens of “corruption through interaction”. Each of the album’s tracks bear titles drawn from populator gaming legends, including the <i>Seventeenth Colossus</i> and Ocarina of Time’s infamous <i>Temple of Light</i>. Some are real, some merely conceptual, but few are deliberately crafted mysteries from the developers. Some stem from glitches, and more are based on secrets that were intended as jokes but confused or disturbed children who saw them.
            </p>
            <p>I think these secrets, these cryptids, carry a negative association because they threaten to break down the fundamentals of each world they are constructed around. Pokemon are not meant to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dQq6_xa8-U" target="_blank">cry in agony</a> upon their encounter. You ought to wake each day with your face arranged as it was in the day previous, not with <a href="https://gaming-urban-legends.fandom.com/wiki/Gyroid_Face" target="_blank">black pools replacing your vacant eyes and mouth</a>. And make no mistake - the world in each of these games is, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/22/ubisofts-new-ai-tool-automatically-generates-dialogue-for-non-playable-game-characters/" target="_blank">until very recently</a>, have always been constructs. These social developments have been interesting to observe precisely because of recent advancements that ensure no stone is left unturned. Abilities once coveted by developers such as Dolphin’s freecam demonstrate just how thin the veil suspending our disbelief actually is. The line begins to blur between audience and maestro - previously, the player was a voluntary actor upon a mere stage. Once prefabricated skies and cameras are taken away, the hollow and vapid side of the creation is revealed. There never was anything behind that mountain, or behind that locked door. Why should there be?
            </p>
            <p>This is what songs such as <i>Reviving Aerith</i> strike at. <i>Hell Valley Sky Trees</i> is melancholic because it represents something that was once unknowable, untouchable. But by the time we had the capability to fly beyond that horizon and meet the creatures we dreamed of confronting face to face, there was never any achievement to be gained. And in my eyes, that’s perhaps even less satisfying than accepting the fact that in a game like Final Fantasy 7 there never was any way to free my companion from death, no absolution to strive toward, because that’s a process that relents in straining this power dynamic between creator and player. <i>Aerith</i> is still sad - debatably the darkest on the album. We hear distant vocal samples and bell chimes. Nopédie describes this piece as “a transition between death and life”, but it also functions just as clearly as a maturation. A way of encapsulating all the discomfort between the phases of growing through childhood and into a jaded adult.
            </p>
            <p>That was a year and a half ago. Nopédie’s newest album, <a href="https://jimnopedie.bandcamp.com/album/keep-it-rolling" target="_blank"><i>Keep It Rolling</i></a>, feels like an attempt to tear down everything <i>Another Childhood</i> represented, and even if that prospect isn’t to everyone’s taste, I really do think it’s the best approach a follow-up could have taken. Each track maintains Jim’s signature array of eclectic samples and modulations, but they’re arranged within a package that feels much more light on the details. The endeavor is much more personal, and in turn more liberating and minimal. Like the previous album, <i>Keep It Rolling</i> shares an odd premise; not for its philosophy, but for its dichotomy as a successor to <i>Childhood</i>. This is a composer known for their brand sculpted around gaming lore choosing to dispose of what effectively brought them into the limelight to begin with. It’s clear from the very first track that is a Jim Nopédie album - not a gaming folkcanon album, or anything else. And that’s a bold quality brought to these tracks I really value.
            </p>
            <p><i>Rolling</i>’s notes indicate that this shift from a concept album to something less defined carried with it a set of structural goals that serve to set it apart from Nopédie’s previous work. If <i>Childhood</i> was evocative, this album is the opposite. It grounds and roots the listener, but does not restrict them.
            </p>
            <p><i>“My rule for Keep It Rolling was that every sound has to be as ‘neutral’ as possible—lots of basic sine waves and square waves, lots of unprocessed piano, not a lot of reverb or atmosphere—so the music doesn’t really evoke another place. It just settles you into whatever place you’re in when you’re listening.”</i>
                <br>-Jim</p>
            <p>Tracks like <i>rube goldberg</i> are fantastic. Clicks and whirs combine to form a kinetic flow of energy. It’s not a complex message to grasp - it’s all in the name. There’s beauty in brevity. Keep it modular, keep it moving.
            </p>
            <p>And I think that's a message that needs to be heard now, more than ever before. After all, if our past lacks objective, as Nopédie's sophmore attempt would suggest, and the future is uncertain, what's left to latch onto? <i>Keep It Rolling</i> posits that it's the "little things" and I think there's beauty in that. Death, to life. Child, to adult, to child again.
